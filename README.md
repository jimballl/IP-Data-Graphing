# IP-Data-Graphing
Used an IP and ISP/country information dataset to input within an IP locator API. The frequencies of the countries' appearances pre- and post-API translation were graphed.

Pre-API graphing is seen within [IP Locations PNG](Graph%20Output/iplocations.png) and Post-API graphing is seen within [IP locations from API PNG](Graph%20Output/iplocations_from_api.png).

Dataset obtained from [IP Sample Database GitHub](https://github.com/ipinfo/sample-database/)

API obtained from [ip-api.com](https://ip-api.com/)
