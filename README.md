# IP-Data-Graphing
Used an IP and ISP/country information dataset to input within an IP locator API. The frequencies of the countries' appearences pre- and post-API translation were graphed.

Pre-API graphing is seen within country_counts.png and Post-API graphing is seen within country_counts_from_api.png.

Dataset obtained from [IP Sample Database GITHUB](https://github.com/ipinfo/sample-database/)
API obtained from [ip-api.com](https://ip-api.com/)
